This code is for an Arduino-based project that uses an LCD display to count and display the number of people in a room based on input from two sensors. Here's how it works:

Functionality:
1. LCD Setup:

The code initializes an LCD display (16x2 characters) via I2C communication and displays the message "Counter: ".
After a 3-second delay, it clears the display and sets up the initial message "Person In Room: 0".
2. Pin Definitions:

Two pins, in (pin 8) and out (pin 7), are set to INPUT mode. These represent the inputs from the sensors for detecting people entering and exiting the room.
3. Entering the Room (Sensor Input):

The program continuously checks the in pin. If a LOW signal is detected (indicating that a person has entered the room), the count variable is incremented, and the updated count is displayed on the LCD.
A 2-second delay is added after updating the count to prevent the code from rapidly counting multiple entries due to sensor noise.
4. Exiting the Room (Sensor Output):

Similarly, the program checks the out pin for a LOW signal (indicating that a person is leaving the room). If the count is greater than 0 (ensuring the count does not go negative), the count is decremented, and the updated value is shown on the LCD.
Again, a 2-second delay is added after updating the count to avoid multiple decrements from a single exit.
5. LCD Display Updates:

The LCD is cleared and updated with the new count of people in the room whenever an entry or exit is detected.


Key Components:
LiquidCrystal_I2C: This library is used to interface with the LCD over I2C communication, allowing the Arduino to control the display efficiently using only two pins.
Input Pins: The in and out sensors are assumed to detect whether someone is entering or leaving the room, triggering a change in the count.


Summary:
This code monitors and displays the number of people in a room, updating a counter on an LCD whenever someone enters or exits, based on input from two sensors. The system is intended for basic occupancy counting.
